# Given an integer, determine if it is a perfect square.

#     A number is a perfect square if you can multiply an integer by itself to achieve the number. For example, 9 is a perfect square because you can multiply 3 by itself to get it.

# 1. is_perfect_square(9) should return True.
# 2. is_perfect_square(49) should return True.
# 3. is_perfect_square(1) should return True.
# 4. is_perfect_square(2) should return False.
# 5. is_perfect_square(99) should return False.
# 6. is_perfect_square(-9) should return False.
# 7. is_perfect_square(0) should return True.
# 8. is_perfect_square(25281) should return True.
